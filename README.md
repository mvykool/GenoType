# GenoType

Typescript types generator. Sharing types with a React frontend, defining types in Rust, and converting them into Ts types.

### Crates
This project relies on 2 crates:

* clap: Short for command line argument parser, popular crate for dealing with command line arguments.
* syn: Derived from syntax, its a crate made to convert rust code into a type-safe syntax tree, allowing tokens to be parsed individually
